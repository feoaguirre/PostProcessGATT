# PostProcessGATT

This repository is a collection of functions that may be useful to new GATT USP students.

It contains the following structure: a Matlab folder, a Python folder, and a Labview folder, all of which have the respective format functions.

The codes stay in two big folders: Numerical or Experimental

# Numerical Folder:

Codes used for gap, bump/step, and universal codes (used for both). Each folder contains a readme with the functions and folders for functions in Python and Matlab.

# Experimental Folder:

Codes used to process the experiment and codes used to execute the experiment, in Matlab and Labview.

Necessary programs for the GATT USP students: 

Matlab (2018a or new)

python3
